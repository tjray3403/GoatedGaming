        <h2> Adventure games are a genre of video games that involve exploration and puzzle-solving. The player
            typically takes on the role of a protagonist who navigates through a story-driven narrative, interacting
            with characters and objects in the game world to progress the storyline. Adventure games often prioritize
            storytelling and player choice over action-oriented gameplay. </h2>
